# Coffee Machine

The Coffee Machine is a program that simulates the functionality of a coffee machine. Users can choose from a menu of coffee options, make payments, and receive their desired coffee. The program keeps track of available resources such as water, milk, and coffee, and calculates the cost of each order.

## Features

- Menu: The coffee machine offers a menu with different coffee options, including espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- Resource Management: The program tracks the available resources and ensures that there are sufficient ingredients for each order.
- Payment Processing: Users can insert coins to pay for their coffee orders. The program calculates the total payment and provides change if necessary.
- Coffee Preparation: Once the order is placed and payment is received, the coffee machine prepares the selected coffee by deducting the required ingredients from the available resources.
- Reporting: Users can request a report that displays the current status of the available resources and the total profit earned.
